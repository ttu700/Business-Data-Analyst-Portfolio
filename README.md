## [Project 0: Dynamic Stock Research Dashboard](https://github.com/ttu700/Stock-Research-Dashboard)
This data analysis project on stocks was inspired by my past years in trading! The data was acquired straight from alphavantage API. I utilized power-query and a bit of m-code to clean up the dataset and make it look better. Anyways, I always wanted to have a neat little dashboard that had functional applications. Feel free to download and use it for yourself. You can adjust the ticker to show different stock prices as well as news sentiments. Let me know if there are any features that you would like.
