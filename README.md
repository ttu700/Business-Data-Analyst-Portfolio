Stroke prediction Analysis predicts the likelihood of a stroke for an individual depending on their age, BMI, smoking status, gender, and other various diseases.
## [Project 3: Earnings Impact Across Industries Analysis](https://github.com/ttu700/Earnings-Impact-Across-Industries-Analysis)
Earning announcements can have a significant impact on the price of stocks and we aim to understand the relationship between earnings announcements and the stock's price. A thorough understanding of how earnings announcement releases impact the price of a stock can help us to make informed investment decisions and minimize investment risk.
## [Project 4: Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project](https://github.com/ttu700/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project)
A fictitious company Salifort Motors' HR department seeks data-driven insights to improve employee satisfaction and retention. Tasked with analyzing collected employee data, your project goal is to build a predictive model identifying factors that contribute to employee turnover. Anticipating employee departures can enable strategic interventions, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming hiring processes, and ultimately benefiting the company.

## [Project 5: Data Professional Breakdown Dashboard](https://github.com/ttu700/Data-Professional-Breakdown-Dashboard/)
The Data Professionals Dashboard project involves the meticulous cleaning and formatting of data collected from a comprehensive survey targeting 700 data professionals. This initiative is designed to provide a holistic understanding of the current trends, challenges, and preferences within the data professional community. Leveraging the power of Power BI, I have transformed this rich dataset into an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
