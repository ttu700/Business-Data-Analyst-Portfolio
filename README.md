A thorough understanding of how earnings announcement releases impact the price of a stock can help us to make informed investment decisions and minimize investment risk.

A fictitious company Salifort Motors' HR department seeks data-driven insights to improve employee satisfaction and retention. Tasked with analyzing collected employee data, your project goal is to build a predictive model identifying factors that contribute to employee turnover. Anticipating employee departures can enable strategic interventions, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming hiring processes, and ultimately benefiting the company.
